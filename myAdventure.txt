You wake up in the forest, with the sun beating through the trees. You can’t remember what happened the night before, and you don’t know where you are. You wake up and notice your hand can grow bombs. What a surprise! You don’t remember being able to grow bombs out of your hand before, how did you get this power???

You stand up and....

1.	Explore the forest, looking for a way out.


2.	Test out your newfound bomb power.
