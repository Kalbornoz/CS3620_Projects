1.	Explore the forest, looking for a way out.
2.	Test out your newfound bomb power.
3.	Time to test out your newfound power by exploding this boulder
4.	Or, scream from the entrance hoping that a passerby will hear you.
5.	By heading to the sound of the water?
6.	By heading deeper in the forest looking for the sounds of animals you heard.
7.	Time to run the heck away from this bear. You turn and start running as fast as you can
8.	You decide that it’s do or die and start to fight the bear. This may be a good time for use of your bomb hands.
9. I try my luck by using my bomb power to try and kill the animals for food.
10. I decide that having a deer for a mount sounds like a good idea, and begin to sneak around to the deer to be able to jump on it before it has a chance to run.
11. You accept his offer and head into his cabin for breakfast.
12. You thank him kindly, but refuse his offer deciding to head towards the campfire.
13. Towards the sound of the water. You figure bears can’t swim and you’ll be fine if you can just hit the water.
14. Towards the cabin-like structure, with any luck you’ll find the cabin empty, or at the very least an occupant willing to house you.
15: Follow after the sound of that noise
16. Put out your campfire and find a place to sleep.
17. I have bombs that can grow out of my hands! There’s no need for discretion. I’ll just run in throwing my bombs at the enemies.
18. I better stay discrete and pick up some pebbles to toss away from me, hoping to get the giant figure to walk towards that direction.
19.	West towards the river
20.	North back towards the direction of the cabin
21. I attempt to knock out the figure with the rock
22. I pull out my bombs and get ready for a fight.
